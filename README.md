# 11_1_18: Making figures with ggplot

Materials and resources from our meeting on November 11, 2018. 

This meeting introduced users to using the ggplot package for generating scientific figures.

## Prerequisites

Users will require R and R studio, as well as an internet connection to use some of the commands in the guide.

To use the slack channel (optional), users will require a slack account registered to a Tulane email address, as well as an invitation to the channel.

R packages : "ggplot", "slackr" (optional)

## Contents

TURF_ggplot.Rproj : The R project file for this meeting. Open this file first.

TURF_ggplot.R : This R script walks users through the process of generating a figure in ggplot, as well as some of the typical stumbling blocks that new users will encounter.

TURF_ggplot.pptx : Power point slides used in the beginning of the meeting to introduce ggplot use and syntax.

ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf : A useful reference document for ggplot syntax.


## How to use these files

Download this entire folder and extract the contents on your home computer.

If you have never used ggplot before, we encourage you to review the included powerpoint slides before opening the project file.

In this session, we used a slack workspace to share files and code during the meeting. The attached r script contains some instructions for connecting your R workspace to slack. This is not necessary for the use of ggplot, but if you would like to connect to the TURF slack group please contact Willi (wwilber@tulane.edu).
